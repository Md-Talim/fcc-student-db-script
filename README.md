## Project Overview

This project involved creating a bash script to populate a PostgreSQL database named "students" with data from CSV files. The script handles inserting majors, courses, and students into their respective tables while establishing relationships between them.

## Learning Experience

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with **bash scripting**. Key takeaways include:

- **Data Processing:** Using `cat` and `while` loops to read CSV files line by line.
- **Conditional Logic:** Implementing if statements to handle missing data or duplicates.
- **Database Interaction:** Utilizing PostgreSQL commands within the script to insert data into tables.
- **Error Handling:** Checking for successful insertion operations.

Overall, this project helped me understand how bash scripts can be used for automating tasks involving file processing and database management.
